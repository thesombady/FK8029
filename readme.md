# Computational physics spring 2024
This repository is a collection of projects, all performed during the spring semester of 2024 for the course FK8029 at Stockholm University.

It includes problems such as:
1. Half-life of alpha decaying particles (Potential Barrier Model)
2. Solving the time-independent Schr√∂dinger equation via Finite Difference Method (FDM)
3. Variational Monte Carlo
4. Splines
5. Lotka-Volterra equations

The projects were written in different languages, being C++, Python, and V. The languages of choice was depending on the task at hand itself.
